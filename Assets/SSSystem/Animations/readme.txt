- Question:
Why did you create Unity-Animation for nGUI but animation-scripts for uGUI?

- Answer:
I just want to show that SS-System can use both Unity-Animation or animation-scripts for animating your scene views.
Not related to the UI-type is nGUI or uGUI or any libraries.

Remember that if you want to write scripts for animating, inherite them from SSMotion.
If you want to create Unity-Animation, drag SSAnimation to your animation game object, then drag your Unity-Animations to it.
